# Coin Toss Simulator ðŸª™

This is a beginner-friendly Python script that simulates a coin toss. It uses Python's built-in `random` module to randomly select between HEADS and TAILS.

## How it works

- The script sets two values: 0 (HEADS) and 1 (TAILS)
- It uses `random.randint(0, 1)` to generate a random outcome
- Based on the result, it prints either "HEADS" or "TAILS"

## Usage

Run the script with Python:

```bash
python coin_toss.py
